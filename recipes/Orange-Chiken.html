        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Orange chicken is a popular Chinese-American dish known for its sweet, tangy, and slightly spicy flavor. 
            It typically consists of bite-sized pieces of crispy, deep-fried chicken (usually made with boneless, skinless chicken thigh or breast),
             coated in a sticky orange-flavored sauce.</p>
