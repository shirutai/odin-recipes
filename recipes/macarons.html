        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Macarons (not to be confused with macaroons, the coconut cookies) are delicate, colorful French sandwich cookies<br>
             made with almond flour, egg whites, and powdered sugar. They're known for their crisp, smooth shells and soft, chewy interiors,<br>
             filled with a rich ganache, buttercream, or jam.</p>

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>4 extra large egg whites</li>
            <li>1 ⅔ cups confectioners' sugar</li>
            <li>1 ⅓ cups almond flour</li>
            <li>⅛ teaspoon salt</li>
            <li>¼ cup superfine (<a href=https://www.bbc.co.uk/food/caster_sugar#:~:text=This%20is%20the,be%20free%2Dflowing.><strong>castor</strong></a>) sugar</li>
            <li>chocolate ganache, seedless jam, or buttercream for filling</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <br /><li>Place egg whites into a metal mixing bowl and refrigerate overnight.<br> The next day, bring egg whites to room temperature.</li>
            <br /><li>Preheat the oven to 280 degrees F (138 degrees C).<br> Line two baking sheets with parchment paper.</li>
            <br /><li>Whisk confectioners' sugar and almond flour together in a bowl.</li>
            <br /><li>Beat egg whites with salt in a metal bowl with an electric mixer on medium speed<br>
            until foamy, about 1 minute. Increase speed to high and gradually beat in superfine sugar, about 1 tablespoon at a time,<br>
            until egg whites are glossy and hold stiff peaks, 3 to 5 more minutes.</li>
