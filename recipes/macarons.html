        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Macarons (not to be confused with macaroons, the coconut cookies) are delicate, colorful French sandwich cookies<br>
             made with almond flour, egg whites, and powdered sugar. Theyâ€™re known for their crisp, smooth shells and soft, chewy interiors,<br>
             filled with a rich ganache, buttercream, or jam.</p>
