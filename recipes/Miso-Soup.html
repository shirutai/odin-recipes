        <p><strong>Miso Soup</strong> is a traditional Japanese soup made primarily from a fermented soybean paste called <strong>miso</strong>, which gives the soup its signature savory <strong>(umami)</strong> flavor. 
            It's a staple in Japanese cuisine and is commonly served as a side dish with meals, especially breakfast or as part of a multi-course meal.</p>
